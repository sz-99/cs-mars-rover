# The Mars Rover Project
This is an console app that simulates a space trip to mars. Users are able to define the plateau that they would like explore, land on Mars, and move around.

## Installation
The solution file can be opened with Visual Studio 2022, then the experience will begin using 'Start Debugging'.

## Developers Use
This open source project is open to amendments and pull requests.

Here is a brief introduction of the structure of the project:

An **InputParser** class operates on the validation and recording of user input, of which will later be used be the rest of the program.
A **Rover** class represents the player instances, of which one or more will exist in the app.
A **PlateauSize** class dictates the area of movement of the rovers.
A series of **Tests** are set up for each method for thorough implementation.
